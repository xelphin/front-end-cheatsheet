    <div class="grand-child group1"></div>
  </div>
  <div class="child group2">

</main>
```
#### css


<details>
        <summary>Children</summary>

```css
main div {
  /* all children and grandchildren */
}
```
```css
main > div {
  /* all children */
}
```
```css
main > div > div{
  /* all grandchildren */
}
```
</details>

<details>
        <summary>Siblings</summary>

```css
.group1 + div {
  /* only div with the class "child group2" */
}
```
```css
.group1 + div + div {
  /* only div with the class "child group3" */
}
```
```css
.group1 ~ div {
  /* select all of .group1's siblings - in this case the 2nd and 3rd .child divs */
}
```
</details>


### Backwards ancestry
```css
.child-class > .ancestor-class {
  color: red;
}
```

## Dynamic and user action pseudo-classes

Example
```css
/* This will apply to unvisited links */
a:link {
  color: blue;
}

/* And you guessed it, this applies to all links the user has clicked on */
a:visited {
  color: purple;
}
```
Other:

- ```:focus``` element currently selected by user
- ```:hover``` element who has user mouse over it
- ```:active``` element that is being clicked

## Structural pseudo-classes
 
<details>
        <summary>:root</summary>

represents the very top level of your document - the one element that has no parents. Generally when working with the web, this is equivalent to the html element

is generally the place where you will place your â€˜globalâ€™ CSS rules that you want available everywhere - such as your custom properties and CSS variables, or rules such as box-sizing: border-box;

</details>

<details>
        <summary>:first-child and :last-child </summary>

will match elements that are the first or last sibling

</details>

<details>
        <summary>:empty </summary>

match elements that have no children at all

</details>

<details>
        <summary>:only-child </summary>

will match elements that donâ€™t have any siblings

</details>

<details>
        <summary>:nth-child </summary>

```css
.myList:nth-child(5) {/* Selects the 5th element with class myList */}

.myList:nth-child(3n) { /* Selects every 3rd element with class myList */}

.myList:nth-child(3n + 3) { /* Selects every 3rd element with class myList, beginning with the 3rd */}

.myList:nth-child(even) {/* Selects every even element with class myList */}
```

</details>

## Pseudo-Elements

<details>
        <summary>::marker</summary>

allows you to customize the styling of your <li> elementsâ€™ bullets or numbers.

</details>
<details>
        <summary>::first-letter and ::first-line</summary>

allows you to give special styling to the first letter or line of some text

</details>
<details>
        <summary>::selection</summary>

allows you to change the highlighting when a user selects text on the page.

</details>
<details>
        <summary>::before and ::after</summary>

allow us to add extra elements onto the page with CSS, instead of HTML. Using it to decorate text in various ways is one common use case.

```html
<style>
  .emojify::before {
    content: 'ðŸ˜Ž ðŸ¤“';
}

  .emojify::after {
    content: 'ðŸ¤“ ðŸ˜Ž';
}
</style>

<body>
  <div> Let's <span class="emojify">emojify</span>this span!</div>
</body>
```
We'll get: ```Letâ€™s ðŸ˜Ž ðŸ¤“ emojify ðŸ¤“ ðŸ˜Ž this span!```

</details>

## Attribute Selectors

Attribute is simply anything in the opening tag of an HTML element - such as ```src='picture.jpg'``` or ```href="www.theodinproject.com"```



- ```[attribute]``` - This general selector will select anything where the given attribute exists. Its value doesnâ€™t matter.
- ```selector[attribute]``` - Optionally we can combine our attribute selectors with other types of selectors, such as class or element selectors.
- ```[attribute="value"]``` - To get really specific, we can use = to match a specific attribute with a specific value.

<details>
        <summary>Demo</summary>

```css
[src] {
  /* This will target any element that has a src attribute. */
}

img[src] {
  /* This will only target img elements that have a src attribute. */
}

img[src="puppy.jpg"] {
  /* This will target img elements with a src attribute that is exactly "puppy.jpg" */
}
```
</details>




- ```[attribute^="value"]``` - ```^=``` Will match strings from the start.
- ```[attribute$="value"]``` - ```$=``` Will match strings from the end.
- ```[attribute*="value"]``` - ```*=``` The wildcard selector will match anywhere inside the string.



<details>
        <summary>Demo</summary>
        
```css
[class^='aus'] {
  /* Classes are attributes too!
    This will target any class that begins with 'aus':
    class='austria'
    class='australia'
  */
}

[src$='.jpg'] {
  /* This will target any src attribute that ends in '.jpg':
  src='puppy.jpg'
  src='kitten.jpg'
  */
}

[for*='ill'] {
  /* This will target any for attribute that has 'ill' anywhere inside it:
  for="bill"
  for="jill"
  for="silly"
  for="ill"
  */
}
```
</details>
