# HTML Basics

## Init HTML

In VSCode, write "!" in a .html page and click enter for the boilerplate

> Note: you need to have an ```index.html``` page in your repo (homepage)

Will look like this:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
    <title>Title of HTML page</title>
    <link href="./resources/css/style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- BODY -->
  </body>
</html>
```

## Comments

```html
<!-- Like this -->
```

## View HTML code 

Linux:

1. You can **drag and drop** an HTML file from your text editor into the address bar of your browser.

2. You can find the HTML file in your file system and then **double click it**. This will open up the file in the default browser your system uses.

3. You can use the terminal to open the file in your browser. Navigate to the directory containing the file and **type google-chrome index.html**
